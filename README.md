# Notebook showcase

Some Jupyter notebooks I have created over the years.

Structure:
* symbolic - symbolic calculations mostly using [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org/)
  * DG examples - create examples for [Discontinuous Galerkin method, its analysis and implementation into SfePy package](https://zenodo.org/record/3947773)
  * DG polyspaces - calculate Legendre polynom basis
* stats - interesting statistical analyses presented in notebooks (these probably will not work due to lack of data of incorrect environment)
