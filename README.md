# Notebook showcase

Some Jupyter notebooks I have created over the years.

Structure:
* symbolic - symbolic calculations mostly using [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org/)
  * DG examples - create examples for [Discontinuous Galerkin method, its analysis and implementation into SfePy package](https://zenodo.org/record/3947773)
  * DG polyspaces - calculate Legendre polynom basis
  * `quantum_tensor_prod.ipynb` - some quantum gates and states modelled using numpy a sympy
  * `custering_purity.ipynb` - preliminary analysis of purity and coverage measures for clustering problem
* stats - interesting statistical analyses presented in notebooks (these probably will not work due to lack of data of incorrect environment)
